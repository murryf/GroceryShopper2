# GroceryShopper2
A small application to shop through groceries
<br><br>
The application is RESTful and utilizes SpringBoot with Maven managing dependency.
<br>
CRUD operations are sent through to a PostgreSQL server running on my local machine. The format is {"item_id":Long,"item_name":Varchar,"item_price":Float}. Feel free to copy and build your own DB. 
<br><br>
I created this application to practice RESTful design and SpringBoot. This is not a finalized project; I am utilizing Github for version control.
<br><br>
Happy Coding
